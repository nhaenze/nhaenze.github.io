My research examines the interplay between the natural environment and politics, with a particular focus on how political factors shape societies’ vulnerability to climate impacts, the long-term institutional consequences of repeated hazard exposure, and the role of the international community in assisting vulnerable populations.\nI am interested in both the causes and consequences of environmental shocks. On the one hand, I investigate why some societies are more vulnerable to natural hazards than others, analyzing how political structures, armed conflict, and institutional weaknesses exacerbate disaster impacts. On the other hand, I examine how these shocks, in turn, shape political dynamics - whether by fostering or eroding social cohesion, triggering institutional reform, fueling conflict or attracting aid. My research combines insights from political science, environmental studies, and economics to understand how climate risks interact with governance and inequality on both national and subnational levels.\nMethodologically, I employ state-of-the-art quantitative and spatial approaches to investigate these questions. My work contributes to the broader understanding of how environmental shocks interact with political structures, influencing governance, conflict, and international aid. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a BA from Osnabrück University and an MA from the University of Konstanz."

My research in this area examines the political and economic factors that influence the distribution of international climate adaptation aid. While donor states and international organizations have pledged to support vulnerable populations, aid allocation often follows political and strategic considerations rather than actual climate risk.\nFor example, in collaboration with Viktoria Jansesberger, I analyze subnational adaptation aid distribution in the Philippines. Using a novel geo-coded dataset of climate adaptation projects, we investigate whether hazard exposure, vulnerability, or recent disaster impacts drive aid allocation. Our findings suggest that immediate humanitarian crises - rather than structural risk components - are the primary drivers of adaptation aid, raising concerns about the effectiveness of current funding mechanisms in building long-term resilience.\nPapers\nWho needs it the most: Climate risks as catalysts for climate adaptation aid allocation?

    "text": "Abstract: Can armed conflict amplify the societal impacts and humanitarian consequences of natural hazards? Given that these hazards affect millions of people worldwide and that climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, it is paramount that we advance our understanding of what makes societies vulnerable to these hazards. Existing research has focused mainly on political violence as a consequence of natural hazard-related disasters but has neglected that conflict can also be an underlying factor that shapes the impact of these events. Consequently, we know little about whether and how exposure to violent armed conflict increases vulnerability to natural hazards. This study argues that the local dynamics of conflict can have a significant effect on vulnerability and empirically investigates how periods of high-intensity conflict can affect the humanitarian consequences of natural hazards in the context of tropical cyclones in the Philippines. By combining data on physical storm exposure with highly detailed subnational data on disaster fatalities and conflict events, the empirical analysis allows the identification of the independent effect of conflict on hazard impacts. Results show that local periods of high-intensity conflict significantly increase the humanitarian consequences of natural hazards. These results have important implications for research investigating the impacts of disasters on peace and conflict, as they show that the consequences of natural disasters depend fundamentally on pre-existing conflict dynamics."

By impacting agricultural production, climate change is likely to further decrease food consumption, particularly in sub-Saharan African states. Against this backdrop, various actors have called for more attention to alternative farming and food systems based on traditional agricultural knowledge capable of ensuring access to sufficient, nutritious, and safe food. So far, however, we have limited systematic evidence on which traditional agricultural practices may promote the food resilience of households exposed to extreme climatic conditions. Focusing on the most prevalent traditional diversification practices in Tanzania, this study assesses the extent to which crop diversification, annual crop intercropping, crop-tree intercropping, crop-livestock integration, and the cultivation of traditional crops increase the food availability and dietary diversity of smallholders facing extreme weather events in Tanzania.\n:::"

We find that the effect of hazard exposure depends on the degree of equality of hazard exposure between ethnic groups.\nAnother project explores how natural disasters act catalyst for the expansion of state authority. Historically, external pressures and crises like war have often prompted expansionary institutional reforms. The project examines how and why societies that experience repeated exposure to natural hazards adapt their political structures over time, whether through increased state capacity, new taxation mechanisms, or shifts in governance norms. I argue that natural hazards are an informational signal that shows that current state institutions are insufficient to provide protection. This, in turn, can make citizens more accepting of state authority. By analyzing historical data on earthquakes and fiscal institutions, I show that significant earthquakes have led to an expansion of state authority and capacity.\nPapers\nClimate and cohesion: The effects of droughts on intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic trust,  Journal of Peace Research , 2021 (With Alexander De Juan). \n Signaling Threat: How Natural Disasters Shape Political Institutions.
