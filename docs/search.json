My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

My research examines the interplay between climate change and politics. Specifically, I am interested in how political factors like armed conflict shape societies’ vulnerability to climate impacts, the security implications of climate change, and the role of the international community in assisting vulnerable populations through climate aid.\nI am interested in both the causes and consequences of climate and environmental shocks. On the one hand, I investigate why some societies are more vulnerable to climate hazards than others. I analyze how armed conflict, political institutions, and social inequalities exacerbate climate change impacts. On the other hand, I examine how these shocks shape political dynamics - whether by fueling conflict, triggering institutional reforms, fostering or eroding social cohesion, or attracting international aid. My research combines insights from political science, conflict studies, and environmental research to understand how climate risks interact with politics, institutions, and inequality on the international, national, and subnational levels. Ultimately, I hope to provide evidence-based insights that help protect vulnerable populations in a changing climate.\nMy work has been published in the Journal of Peace Research, Political Geography, and Africa Spectrum. Methodologically, I employ quantitative and spatial approaches of causal inference, as well as formal theory to investigate these questions. My research contributes to the broader understanding of how environmental shocks interact with political structures, influencing governance, conflict, and international aid. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a BA from Osnabrück University and an MA from the University of Konstanz.\nI’m also recipient of the Christiane-Rajewsky-Price (2023) by the German Association for Peace and Conflict Studies (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Friedens- und Konfliktforschung)."

My research in this area examines the political and economic factors that influence the distribution of international climate adaptation aid. While donor states and international organizations have pledged to support vulnerable populations, aid allocation often follows political and strategic considerations rather than actual climate risk.\nFor example, in collaboration with Viktoria Jansesberger, I analyze subnational adaptation aid distribution in the Philippines. Using a novel geo-coded dataset of climate adaptation projects, we investigate whether hazard exposure, vulnerability, or recent disaster impacts drive aid allocation. Our findings suggest that immediate humanitarian crises - rather than structural risk components - are the primary drivers of adaptation aid, raising concerns about the effectiveness of current funding mechanisms in building long-term resilience.\nPapers\nDoes climate adaptation aid reach those most in need?

    "text": "Abstract: Can armed conflict amplify the societal impacts and humanitarian consequences of natural hazards? Given that these hazards affect millions of people worldwide and that climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, it is paramount that we advance our understanding of what makes societies vulnerable to these hazards. Existing research has focused mainly on political violence as a consequence of natural hazard-related disasters but has neglected that conflict can also be an underlying factor that shapes the impact of these events. Consequently, we know little about whether and how exposure to violent armed conflict increases vulnerability to natural hazards. This study argues that the local dynamics of conflict can have a significant effect on vulnerability and empirically investigates how periods of high-intensity conflict can affect the humanitarian consequences of natural hazards in the context of tropical cyclones in the Philippines. By combining data on physical storm exposure with highly detailed subnational data on disaster fatalities and conflict events, the empirical analysis allows the identification of the independent effect of conflict on hazard impacts. Results show that local periods of high-intensity conflict significantly increase the humanitarian consequences of natural hazards. These results have important implications for research investigating the impacts of disasters on peace and conflict, as they show that the consequences of natural disasters depend fundamentally on pre-existing conflict dynamics."

By impacting agricultural production, climate change is likely to further decrease food consumption, particularly in sub-Saharan African states. Against this backdrop, various actors have called for more attention to alternative farming and food systems based on traditional agricultural knowledge capable of ensuring access to sufficient, nutritious, and safe food. So far, however, we have limited systematic evidence on which traditional agricultural practices may promote the food resilience of households exposed to extreme climatic conditions. Focusing on the most prevalent traditional diversification practices in Tanzania, this study assesses the extent to which crop diversification, annual crop intercropping, crop-tree intercropping, crop-livestock integration, and the cultivation of traditional crops increase the food availability and dietary diversity of smallholders facing extreme weather events in Tanzania.\n:::"

In this line of research, I examine how environmental pressures influence conflict, social and political cohesion, and state-building processes.\nFor example, in an article with Alexander De Juan in the  Journal of Peace Research, I investigate how prolonged drought conditions influence intra- and inter-ethnic trust - an often invoked mechanism of how climate change can fuel armed conflicts. Importantly, we find that the effect of drought exposure depends on the degree of equality of hazard exposure between ethnic groups.\nAnother project explores how natural disasters act catalyst for the expansion of state authority. Historically, external pressures like warfare have prompted expansionary institutional reforms. This project examines how and why societies that experience repeated exposure to natural hazards adapt their political structures, whether through increased state capacity, new taxation mechanisms, or shifts in governance norms. I argue that natural hazards are an informational signal that shows that current state institutions are insufficient to provide protection. This, in turn, can make citizens more accepting of increased state authority. By analyzing historical data on earthquakes and fiscal institutions, I show that significant earthquakes have led to an expansion of state authority and capacity.\nPapers\nClimate and cohesion: The effects of droughts on intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic trust,  Journal of Peace Research,  2021 (With Alexander De Juan). \n How Natural Disaster Shape Political Institutions: Evidence from Earthquakes and Income Tax Introductions.
